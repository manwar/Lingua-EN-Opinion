I begin this story with a neutral statement.  
Basically this is a very silly test.  
You are testing the Lingua::EN::Opinion package using short, inane sentences.  
I am actually very happy today. 
I have finally finished writing this package.  
Tomorrow I will be very sad. 
I won't have anything left to do. 
I might get angry and decide to do something horrible.  
I might destroy the entire package and start from scratch.  
Then again, I might find it satisfying to have completed my this package. 
You might even say it's beautiful!
